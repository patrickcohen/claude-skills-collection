# Query Efficiency Auditor (L3 Worker)

Specialized worker auditing database query patterns for redundancy, inefficiency, and misuse.

## Purpose & Scope

- **Worker in ln-650 coordinator pipeline** - invoked by ln-650-persistence-performance-auditor
- Audit **query efficiency** (Priority: HIGH)
- Check redundant fetches, batch operation misuse, caching scope problems
- Return structured findings with severity, location, effort, recommendations
- Calculate compliance score (X/10) for Query Efficiency category

## Inputs (from Coordinator)

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/task_delegation_pattern.md#audit-coordinator--worker-contract` for contextStore structure.

Receives `contextStore` with: `tech_stack`, `best_practices`, `db_config` (database type, ORM settings), `codebase_root`.

**Domain-aware:** Supports `domain_mode` + `current_domain`.

## Workflow

1) **Parse context from contextStore**
   - Extract tech_stack, best_practices, db_config
   - Determine scan_path (same logic as ln-624)

2) **Scan codebase for violations**
   - All Grep/Glob patterns use `scan_path`
   - Trace call chains for redundant fetches (requires reading caller + callee)

3) **Collect findings with severity, location, effort, recommendation**

4) **Calculate score using penalty algorithm**

5) **Return JSON result to coordinator**

## Audit Rules (Priority: HIGH)

### 1. Redundant Entity Fetch
**What:** Same entity fetched from DB twice in a call chain

**Detection:**
- Find function A that calls `repo.get(id)` or `session.get(Model, id)`, then passes `id` (not object) to function B
- Function B also calls `repo.get(id)` or `session.get(Model, id)` for the same entity
- Common pattern: `acquire_next_pending()` returns job, but `_process_job(job_id)` re-fetches it

**Detection patterns (Python/SQLAlchemy):**
- Grep for `repo.*get_by_id|session\.get\(|session\.query.*filter.*id` in service/handler files
- Trace: if function receives `entity_id: int/UUID` AND internally does `repo.get(entity_id)`, check if caller already has entity object
- Check `expire_on_commit` setting: if `False`, objects remain valid after commit

**Severity:**
- **HIGH:** Redundant fetch in API request handler (adds latency per request)
- **MEDIUM:** Redundant fetch in background job (less critical)

**Recommendation:** Pass entity object instead of ID, or remove second fetch when `expire_on_commit=False`

**Effort:** S (change signature to accept object instead of ID)

### 2. N-UPDATE/DELETE Loop
**What:** Loop of individual UPDATE/DELETE operations instead of single batch query

**Detection:**
- Pattern: `for item in items: await repo.update(item.id, ...)` or `for item in items: await repo.delete(item.id)`
- Pattern: `for item in items: session.execute(update(Model).where(...))`

**Detection patterns:**
- Grep for `for .* in .*:` followed by `repo\.(update|delete|reset|save|mark_)` within 1-3 lines
- Grep for `for .* in .*:` followed by `session\.execute\(.*update\(` within 1-3 lines

**Severity:**
- **HIGH:** Loop over >10 items (N separate round-trips to DB)
- **MEDIUM:** Loop over <=10 items

**Recommendation:** Replace with single `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (...)` or `session.execute(update(Model).where(Model.id.in_(ids)))`

**Effort:** M (rewrite query + test)

### 3. Unnecessary Resolve
**What:** Re-resolving a value from DB when it is already available in the caller's scope

**Detection:**
- Method receives `profile_id` and resolves engine from it, but caller already determined `engine`
- Method receives `lang_code` and looks up dialect_id, but caller already has both `lang` and `dialect`
- Pattern: function receives `X_id`, does `get(X_id)`, extracts `.field`, when caller already has `field`

**Severity:**
- **MEDIUM:** Extra DB query per invocation, especially in high-frequency paths

**Recommendation:** Split method into two variants: `with_known_value(value, ...)` and `resolving_value(id, ...)`; or pass resolved value directly

**Effort:** S-M (refactor signature, update callers)

### 4. Over-Fetching
**What:** Loading full ORM model when only few fields are needed

**Detection:**
- `session.query(Model)` or `select(Model)` without `.options(load_only(...))` for models with >10 columns
- Especially in list/search endpoints that return many rows
- Pattern: loading full entity but only using 2-3 fields

**Severity:**
- **MEDIUM:** Large models (>15 columns) in list endpoints
- **LOW:** Small models (<10 columns) or single-entity endpoints

**Recommendation:** Use `load_only()`, `defer()`, or raw `select(Model.col1, Model.col2)` for list queries

**Effort:** S (add load_only to query)

### 5. Missing Bulk Operations
**What:** Sequential INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE instead of bulk operations

**Detection:**
- `for item in items: session.add(item)` instead of `session.add_all(items)`
- `for item in items: session.delete(item)` instead of bulk delete
- Pattern: loop with single `INSERT` per iteration

**Severity:**
- **MEDIUM:** Any sequential add/delete in loop (missed batch optimization)

**Recommendation:** Use `session.add_all()`, `session.execute(insert(Model).values(list_of_dicts))`, `bulk_save_objects()`

**Effort:** S (replace loop with bulk call)

### 6. Wrong Caching Scope
**What:** Request-scoped cache for data that rarely changes (should be app-scoped)

**Detection:**
- Service registered as request-scoped (e.g., via FastAPI `Depends()`) with internal cache (`_cache` dict, `_loaded` flag)
- Cache populated by expensive query (JOINs, aggregations) per each request
- Data TTL >> request duration (e.g., engine configurations, language lists, feature flags)

**Detection patterns:**
- Find classes with `_cache`, `_loaded`, `_initialized` attributes
- Check if class is created per-request (via DI registration scope)
- Compare: data change frequency vs cache lifetime

**Severity:**
- **HIGH:** Expensive query (JOINs, subqueries) cached only per-request
- **MEDIUM:** Simple query cached per-request

**Recommendation:** Move cache to app-scoped service (singleton), add TTL-based invalidation, or use CacheService with configurable TTL

**Effort:** M (change DI scope, add TTL logic)

## Scoring Algorithm

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/audit_scoring.md` for unified scoring formula.

## Output Format

Return JSON to coordinator:

```json
{
  "category": "Query Efficiency",
  "score": 6,
  "total_issues": 8,
  "critical": 0,
  "high": 3,
  "medium": 4,
  "low": 1,
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "location": "app/infrastructure/messaging/job_processor.py:434",
      "issue": "Redundant entity fetch: job re-fetched by ID after acquire_next_pending already returned it",
      "principle": "Query Efficiency / DRY Data Access",
      "recommendation": "Pass job object to _process_job instead of job_id",
      "effort": "S"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Critical Rules

- **Do not auto-fix:** Report only
- **Trace call chains:** Rules 1 and 3 require reading both caller and callee
- **ORM-aware:** Check `expire_on_commit`, `autoflush`, session scope before flagging redundant fetches
- **Context-aware:** Small datasets or infrequent operations may justify simpler code
- **Exclude tests:** Do not flag test fixtures or setup code

## Definition of Done

- contextStore parsed (tech_stack, db_config, ORM settings)
- scan_path determined (domain path or codebase root)
- All 6 checks completed:
  - redundant fetch, N-UPDATE loop, unnecessary resolve, over-fetching, bulk ops, caching scope
- Findings collected with severity, location, effort, recommendation
- Score calculated
- JSON returned to coordinator
