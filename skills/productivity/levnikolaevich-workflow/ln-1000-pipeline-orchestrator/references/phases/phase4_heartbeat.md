# Phase 4: Heartbeat & Active Verification

Bidirectional health monitoring combining reactive message processing (phase4_handlers.md) with proactive done-flag verification.

## Context Recovery (Compression Detection)

When Claude Code compresses conversation history during long pipelines, the lead loses SKILL.md instructions and in-memory state. The Stop hook includes `---PIPELINE RECOVERY CONTEXT---` in every heartbeat to enable self-healing.

### Detection

Lead detects context loss when:
- It sees `---PIPELINE RECOVERY CONTEXT---` in heartbeat stderr
- It cannot recall pipeline state variables or ON handlers
- The recovery block contains inline compact state for immediate situational awareness

### Recovery Steps

1. **Read** `.pipeline/state.json` → restore ALL state variables including team_name, business_answers, storage_mode
2. **Read** SKILL.md (FULL) → restore all phases, rules, error handling, anti-patterns
3. **Read** `references/phases/phase4_handlers.md` → restore all ON message handlers
4. **Read** `references/phases/phase4_heartbeat.md` → restore verification + heartbeat output
5. **Read** `references/known_issues.md` → restore self-diagnostic patterns
6. **Set** ephemeral variables: `suspicious_idle = {}`, `heartbeat_count = 0`. Run `ToolSearch("+hashline-edit")` for MCP tools
7. **Resume** event loop: process messages → verify flags → persist state → end turn

### Token Cost

| Scenario | Files Read | Approx Tokens |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Normal heartbeat (no compression) | 0 | 0 |
| After compression (one-time recovery) | 4 files | ~2500 |
| Recovery block in stderr (every heartbeat) | -- | ~120 |

## Active Done-Flag Verification (Step 3)

Detects lost completion messages by checking for done-flags without state transitions. Complements reactive crash detection (ON TeammateIdle) with proactive polling every heartbeat cycle.

**Problem:** Worker creates `done.flag` before `SendMessage`. If message is lost (network, overflow, crash), TeammateIdle hook returns `exit 0`, suppressing TeammateIdle event. Reactive crash detection never triggers.

**Solution:** Proactive verification on each heartbeat checks for flags without corresponding state advancement.

### Algorithm

```
FOR EACH story_id in story_state WHERE state in ["STAGE_0", "STAGE_1", "STAGE_2", "STAGE_3"]:
  worker_name = worker_map[story_id]
  done_flag_path = ".pipeline/worker-{worker_name}-done.flag"

  IF exists(done_flag_path):
    # Worker signaled completion via flag, verify we received the message
    current_stage = extract_stage_number(story_state[story_id])  # STAGE_0 → 0, STAGE_1 → 1, etc.

    # Determine expected state after completion
    next_expected_state = "STAGE_{current_stage + 1}" if current_stage < 3 else "DONE"

    # Check if state has advanced (message received and processed)
    state_advanced = (story_state[story_id] == next_expected_state) OR (story_state[story_id] == "DONE")

    IF NOT state_advanced:
      # Lost message detected: flag exists but handler never ran
      Output: "⚠ Lost completion message for {story_id} at Stage {current_stage}. Attempting recovery from checkpoint..."

      checkpoint = read(".pipeline/checkpoint-{story_id}.json") if exists
      synthetic_recovery_successful = false

      IF checkpoint AND checkpoint.stage == current_stage:
        # Synthetic recovery based on checkpoint + kanban verification

        IF current_stage == 0:
          # Stage 0: Verify tasks created in kanban board
          Re-read kanban board

        ELSE IF current_stage == 3:
          # Stage 3: Verify Story status indicates outcome
          Re-read kanban board
          story_status = get_story_status(story_id)
          verdict = checkpoint.verdict  # Required field per checkpoint schema

            synthetic_recovery_successful = true

      IF NOT synthetic_recovery_successful:
        # Checkpoint missing/invalid - fallback to probe protocol
        Output: "⚠ Cannot recover {story_id} from checkpoint. Sending diagnostic probe..."
        suspicious_idle[story_id] = true
        SendMessage(recipient: worker_name,
                   content: "Status check: are you still working on Stage {current_stage} for {story_id}?",
                   summary: "{story_id} health check")
        # ON worker responds: handled by existing Step 2 handlers (see phase4_handlers.md)
```

## Heartbeat State Persistence (Step 4)

```
ON HEARTBEAT (Stop hook stderr: "HEARTBEAT: N workers, M stories..."):
  Write .pipeline/state.json with ALL state variables:
    complete, active_workers,
    stories_remaining = count(story_state[id] NOT IN ("DONE", "PAUSED")),
    last_check=now,
    story_state, worker_map, quality_cycles, validation_retries,
    crash_count, priority_queue_ids, story_results, infra_issues,
    worktree_map, depends_on, stage_timestamps, git_stats,
    pipeline_start_time, readiness_scores, team_name,
    business_answers, storage_mode, status_cache, skill_repo_path,
    project_brief, story_briefs
  # Full state write enables Phase 0 recovery if lead crashes between heartbeats
  # ALL fields from checkpoint_format.md Pipeline State Schema must be persisted
```

## Structured Heartbeat Output

When no new worker messages received, output brief structured status and immediately let turn end.

**CRITICAL:** Lead must NEVER output "waiting", "standing by", or any passive phrase followed by turn end. This breaks the heartbeat loop — Stop hook will NOT fire if lead is passively waiting.

- **CORRECT:** Brief status → turn ends → Stop hook fires → next heartbeat
- **WRONG:** "Waiting for workers..." → turn ends → Stop hook does NOT fire → pipeline stalls

### Algorithm

```
ON NO NEW MESSAGES (heartbeat cycle with no worker updates):
  # Collect structured worker status for table
  worker_statuses = []
  FOR EACH story_id in story_state WHERE state in ["STAGE_0", "STAGE_1", "STAGE_2", "STAGE_3"]:
    checkpoint = read(".pipeline/checkpoint-{story_id}.json") if exists
    current_stage = extract_stage_number(story_state[story_id])  # STAGE_0 → 0

    # Determine current activity from checkpoint
    IF checkpoint:
      activity = checkpoint.lastAction OR skill_name_from_stage(current_stage)
      progress_fraction = "{len(checkpoint.tasksCompleted)}/{len(checkpoint.tasksCompleted)+len(checkpoint.tasksRemaining)}"
    ELSE:
      activity = skill_name_from_stage(current_stage)  # ln-300, ln-310, ln-400, ln-500
      progress_fraction = "—"

    # Determine status indicator
    IF checkpoint AND checkpoint.timestamp is recent (<5 min):
      status = "Ongoing"
    ELSE IF story just spawned (story in worker_map for <2 min):
      status = "NEW ⭐"
    ELSE:
      status = "Processing"

    worker_statuses.append({
      "story": story_id,
      "stage": "Stage {current_stage}",
      "activity": activity,
      "progress": progress_fraction,
      "status": status
    })

  # Increment heartbeat counter (ephemeral, resets on recovery)
  heartbeat_count++

  # Structured heartbeat output
  Output: """

## Helper Functions

### skill_name_from_stage(stage)

Maps stage number to skill name for activity display.

}
RETURN stage_to_skill[stage]
```

### predict_next_step(current_stage)

Predicts next pipeline action based on current stage.

```
next_steps = {
  0: "Validation (ln-310) → Todo",
  1: "Execution (ln-400) → To Review",
  2: "Quality Gate (ln-500) → Done/To Rework",
  3: "Squash merge to develop → Done"
}
RETURN next_steps[current_stage]
```

### extract_stage_number(state_string)

Extracts numeric stage from state enum.

```
# "STAGE_0" → 0, "STAGE_1" → 1, etc.
IF state_string matches "STAGE_(\d+)":
  RETURN int(matched_group_1)

  RETURN null
